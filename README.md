Crypto API Data Collection and Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to collect real-time cryptocurrency market data using a public API. The notebook includes API integration, data fetching, cleaning, and basic analysis of cryptocurrency market data.

**Project Overview**

The project aims to:

1. Connect to a cryptocurrency API to retrieve live data.

2. Parse and store relevant information (e.g., name, symbol, price, market cap, volume, and percentage change).

3. Structure the data into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

4 . Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), such as sorting top cryptocurrencies by market cap or price.

5. Fetch real-time data from a crypto market API.
